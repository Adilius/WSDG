2. Change directory to repository: `cd AdiliusWSDG/`

3. Install required packages: `pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

## Command Line Arguments

| Command Line Option | Description |
|  :---  |  :---:  |
|-h --help | Show help message and exit |
|-e email | Email used to login into Webhallen |
|-p password | Password used to login into Webhallen |

|-l log_level | Log level options: [DEBUGV, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL] <br/>DEBUG and below level logs will only be printed in console. <br/>DEBUGV also prints username, password, and userid. |


## Enviroment file

Enviroment file stores enviroment variables which can be used for convenience to not input email and password for each run. 
The data is stored in `.env` file encrypted using simple Vigen√®re cipher using hardware adress as key. The encryption is used to store your credentials in ciphertext to stop onlookers. However it is still not safe storage, if your system is compromised the credentials can be extracted with some effort.

## Setting up scheduled task

### Linux
To setup scheduled task in linux simply use crontab jobs.  
To edit cronjobs: `crontab -e`

```

### Windows

$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Daily -At 5:00am
$trigger.StartBoundary = [DateTime]::Parse($trigger.StartBoundary).ToLocalTime().ToString("s")
